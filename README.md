# Advent of Code 2025

Solving 12 days of algorithmic puzzles using Java 25's compact source files. No classes, no fuss—just code that compiles and runs like it's 2025.

## How to Run

Each day is self-contained. Run with:
```
java DayXX.java
```

- `DayXX.input`: Your puzzle input
- `DayXX.test`: Test data

## Progress

All days initialized with boilerplate. Implement `part1` and `part2` methods as puzzles drop.

May the lambda expressions be with you. 🚀
